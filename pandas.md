## **Part 1: Introduction to Pandas**

### **1. Getting Started with Pandas**
Pandas is a versatile and powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. In this section, we'll cover the basics of getting started with Pandas.
#### **1.1. Installation and Setup**
Before you can start using Pandas, you need to install it. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
Once Pandas is installed, you can import it into your Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks using the following import statement:
```python
import pandas as pd

# display used to display more that one pandas df/series 
# per code cell
from IPython.display import display

```
#### **1.2. Creating Series and DataFrames**
Pandas introduces two fundamental data structures: Series and DataFrame.
##### **1.2.1. Series:**
A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold various data types.
```python
import pandas as pd

data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
s = pd.Series(data, name="MySeries")

print(s)
```
##### **1.2.2. DataFrame:**
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure, similar to a table in a database.
```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df
```
#### **1.3. Basic Operations**
Pandas provides several useful functions for exploring and summarizing your data.
##### **1.3.1. head() and tail():**
Display the first or last few rows of a DataFrame.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the first two rows
print(df.head(2))

# Display the last two rows
print(df.tail(2))
```

To display more than one tables in a nicer format from one code cell you can using the following:
```python
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Create a Markdown table for the first two rows
display(Markdown("**First Two Rows:**"))
display(df.head(2))

# Create a Markdown table for the last two rows
display(Markdown("**Last Two Rows:**"))
display(df.tail(2))
```
##### **1.3.2. describe():**
Generate summary statistics of numeric columns.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Age': [25, 30, 22, 35, 28]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display summary statistics
df.describe()
```
##### **1.3.3. info():**
Display information about the DataFrame, including data types and non-null values.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display DataFrame information
df.info()
```
### **2. Indexing and Selecting Data**
Indexing and selecting data are fundamental operations when working with Pandas. In this section, we'll explore different methods for accessing and manipulating data within Series and DataFrames.
#### **2.1. Indexing Methods (loc, iloc)**
Pandas provides two primary methods for indexing and selecting data: `loc` and `iloc`.
##### **2.1.1. loc:**
Select data by label.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['row1', 'row2', 'row3'])

# Select a row by label
display(df.loc['row1'])

# Select a single cell by label
display(df.loc['row2', 'Age'])

# Select multiple rows and columns by label
display(df.loc[['row1', 'row3'], ['Name', 'Age']])
```
##### **2.1.2. iloc:**
Select data by integer position.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Select the second row by integer position
display(df.iloc[1])

# Select a single cell by integer position
display(df.iloc[0, 1])

# Select multiple rows and columns by integer position
display(df.iloc[[0, 2], [0, 1]])
```
#### **2.2. Conditional Selection**
You can use conditional statements to filter data based on specific conditions.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Select rows where Age is greater than 25
selected_rows = df[df['Age'] > 25]

selected_rows
```
#### **2.3. Boolean Series and DataFrame Filtering**
Boolean Series and DataFrames are powerful tools for conditional filtering and selection.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a boolean Series based on a condition
age_above_25 = df['Age'] > 25

# Use the boolean Series to filter the DataFrame
filtered_df = df[age_above_25]

filtered_df
```

You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`&` for AND, `|` for OR).
```python
# Create a boolean Series based on multiple conditions
complex_condition = (df['Age'] > 25) & (df['Name'] != 'Charlie')

# Use the complex boolean Series to filter the DataFrame
filtered_df = df[complex_condition]

filtered_df
```
#### **2.4. Setting and Resetting Index**
You can set and reset the index of a DataFrame to change how data is organized.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Set 'Name' column as index
df.set_index('Name', inplace=True)

print(df)

# Reset index
df.reset_index(inplace=True)

df
```

## **Part 2: Data Handling and Cleaning**

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential steps before performing analysis. In this section, we'll cover various techniques to ensure your data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
#### 3.1. **Handling Duplicate Data**
Duplicate data can distort your analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions. Pandas provides methods to detect and handle duplicate records.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame with duplicate rows
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Alice', 'Charlie', 'Bob'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 25, 22, 28]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

display(Markdown('**Raw Dataframe**'))
display(df)

# Detect duplicate rows
duplicates = df.duplicated()
display(Markdown('**Duplicates**'))
display(duplicates)

# Drop duplicate rows
df_cleaned = df.drop_duplicates()
display(Markdown('**Cleaned Dataframe**'))
display(df_cleaned)
```
#### **3.2. Outlier Detection and Removal**
Outliers can skew your analysis and affect model performance. Pandas allows you to identify and handle outliers.
Note that there are better ways of doing this will using `from scipy.stats import zscore`
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with outliers
data = {'Value': [100, 150, 200, 3000, 220, 250]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate z-scores
z_scores = (df - df.mean()) / df.std()

# Identify and remove outliers
outliers_removed = df[(z_scores < 2).all(axis=1)]

outliers_removed
```
#### **3.3. Text Data Processing**
Text data often requires preprocessing before analysis. Pandas offers tools to clean and manipulate text.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with text data
data = {'Text': ['Hello, world!', 'Python is great.', 'Data analysis']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert text to lowercase
df['Text'] = df['Text'].str.lower()

# Remove punctuation using Pandas str.replace with regex
df['Text'] = df['Text'].str.replace(r'[^\w\s]', '', regex=True)

df
```
#### 3.4. **Handling Missing Data**
Missing data is common in datasets and needs to be handled carefully. Pandas provides methods to fill, drop, or interpolate missing values.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame with missing values
data = {'Value': [10, None, 30, 40, None, 60]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Fill missing values with a specific value
df_filled = df.fillna(0)

# Drop rows with missing values
df_dropped = df.dropna()

display(Markdown("**Filter Dataframe**"))
display(df_filled)

display(Markdown("**Missing values removed Dataframe**"))
display(df_dropped)
```
### **4. Data Visualization with Pandas**
Effective data visualization enhances your understanding of the data. In this section, we'll explore how to create various types of plots using Pandas.
#### **4.1. Line, Bar, and Pie Charts**
```python
import pandas as pd
#import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
data = {'Year': [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019],
        'Sales': [100, 150, 200, 180, 250]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Line chart with custom size
ax = df.plot(x='Year', y='Sales', kind='line', title='Sales Over Years', figsize=(8, 3))

# Bar chart with custom size
ax = df.plot(x='Year', y='Sales', kind='bar', title='Yearly Sales', figsize=(4, 2))

# Pie chart with custom size
ax = df.plot(x='Year', y='Sales', kind='pie', labels=df['Year'], title='Sales Distribution', figsize=(4, 4))

# Show the plots
plt.show()

```
#### **4.2. Histograms and Density Plots**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
data = {'Age': [25, 30, 22, 35, 28, 30, 29, 22, 25, 32]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))

# Histogram
ax1 = df['Age'].plot(kind='hist', bins=5, edgecolor='black')
ax1.set_title('Age Distribution')
ax1.set_xlabel('Age')
ax1.set_ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))

# Density plot
ax2 = df['Age'].plot(kind='density')
ax2.set_title('Age Density Plot')
ax2.set_xlabel('Age')
plt.show()

```
#### **4.3. Scatter and Box Plots**
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for visualization
data = {'Height': [160, 170, 155, 180, 165],
        'Weight': [50, 65, 45, 70, 55]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))

# Scatter plot
ax1 = df.plot(x='Height', y='Weight', kind='scatter')
ax1.set_title('Height vs Weight')
ax1.set_xlabel('Height')
ax1.set_ylabel('Weight')
plt.show()

# Set the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))

# Box plot
ax2 = df.plot(kind='box')
ax2.set_title('Height and Weight Box Plot')
ax2.set_ylabel('Values')
plt.show()

```

## **Part 3: Data Analysis with Pandas**

### **5. Data Aggregation and Grouping**
Data aggregation and grouping are essential for summarizing and analyzing data effectively. In this section, we'll explore techniques for aggregating data and performing group-based operations.
#### **5.1. Multi-level Grouping**
Pandas supports multi-level grouping, allowing you to group data by multiple columns.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame for grouping
data = {'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT'],
        'Employee': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
        'Salary': [60000, 75000, 55000, 80000, 70000]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
display(Markdown("**Raw df**"))
display(df)

# Group by multiple columns
grouped = df.groupby(['Department', 'Employee']).sum()
display(Markdown("**Grouped df**"))
display(grouped)
```
#### **5.2. Custom Aggregation Functions**
You can apply custom aggregation functions to grouped data.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for custom aggregation
data = {'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT'],
        'Salary': [60000, 75000, 55000, 80000, 70000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define a custom aggregation function
def salary_range(series):
    return series.max() - series.min()

# Apply custom aggregation function
result = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].agg(salary_range)

result
```
#### **5.3. Transformation and Filtration**
Transformation and filtration enable you to modify data within groups.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for transformation and filtration
data = {'Department': ['HR', 'Finance', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT'],
        'Salary': [60000, 75000, 55000, 80000, 70000]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the mean salary for each department
df['MeanSalary'] = df.groupby('Department')['Salary'].transform('mean')

# Filter departments with mean salary above a threshold
high_salary_departments = df.groupby('Department').filter(lambda x: x['MeanSalary'].mean() > 65000)

high_salary_departments
```
### **6. Advanced Data Manipulation**
Advanced data manipulation techniques allow you to reshape and combine data for analysis.
#### **6.1 Combining and Reshaping Data**
You can combine DataFrames using methods like `merge`, `concat`, and reshape them using `pivot` and `melt`.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create two DataFrames for combining and reshaping
data1 = {'ID': [1, 2, 3],
         'Value1': [10, 20, 30]}
data2 = {'ID': [2, 3, 4],
         'Value2': [200, 300, 400]}

df1 = pd.DataFrame(data1)
df2 = pd.DataFrame(data2)

# Concatenate pandas objects along a particular axis 
# note axis{0/’index’, 1/’columns’}, default 0
concat = pd.concat([df1, df2], join="inner", axis=1)

# Combine DataFrames using merge
merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='ID', how='inner')

# Reshape the merged DataFrame using pivot
pivoted = merged.pivot(index='ID', columns='Value1', values='Value2')

display(Markdown("**df1**"))
display(df1)
display(Markdown("**df2**"))
display(df2)

display(Markdown("**Concat df**"))
display(concat)

display(Markdown("**Merged df**"))
display(merged)

display(Markdown("**Pivot df**"))
display(pivoted)
```
#### **6.2. Stacking and Unstacking**
You can stack and unstack data to transform between wide and long formats.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame for stacking and unstacking
data = {'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-02'],
        'Metric': ['Revenue', 'Expense', 'Revenue'],
        'Value': [1000, 500, 1200]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Pivot the DataFrame
# pivot_df = df.pivot(index='Date', columns='Metric', values='Value')

# Stack the DataFrame
stacked = df.stack()

# Unstack the DataFrame
unstacked = df.unstack()

display(Markdown("**Raw df**"))
display(df)

display(Markdown("**Stacked df**"))
display(stacked)

display(Markdown("**Unstacked df**"))
display(unstacked)

```
#### **6.3. Melting and Pivoting**
Melting is the inverse of pivoting and transforms wide data to long format.
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame for melting and pivoting
data = {'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-01', '2023-01-02'],
        'Revenue': [1000, 1200, 1500],
        'Expense': [500, 600, 800]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Melt the DataFrame
melted = df.melt(id_vars='Date', var_name='Metric', value_name='Value')

# Aggregate the melted DataFrame (e.g., by summing values for duplicate entries)
aggregated = melted.groupby(['Date', 'Metric'])['Value'].sum().reset_index()

# Pivot the aggregated DataFrame
pivoted = aggregated.pivot(index='Date', columns='Metric', values='Value')

display(Markdown("**Melted df**"))
display(melted)

display(Markdown("**Aggregated df**"))
display(aggregated)

display(Markdown("**Pivoted df**"))
display(pivoted)

```

## **Part 4: Time Series Analysis**

### **7. Working with Time Series Data**
Time series data analysis is crucial for understanding trends and patterns over time. In this section, we'll explore various techniques to analyze and manipulate time series data using Pandas.
#### **7.1. Time Zone Handling**
Pandas allows you to handle time zone information in your time series data.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with time series data
data = {'Timestamp': ['2023-08-01 08:00:00', '2023-08-01 09:00:00', '2023-08-01 10:00:00'],
        'Value': [100, 150, 200]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Set time zone
df['Timestamp'] = df['Timestamp'].dt.tz_localize('UTC')

df
```
#### **7.2. Shifting and Lagging**
Shifting and lagging time series data can help you calculate changes and trends.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with time series data
data = {'Timestamp': ['2023-08-01 08:00:00', '2023-08-01 09:00:00', '2023-08-01 10:00:00'],
        'Value': [100, 150, 200]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Calculate time difference and shift data
df['TimeDiff'] = df['Timestamp'].diff()
df['ValueDiff'] = df['Value'].diff()

df
```
#### **7.3. Handling Irregular Time Series**
Pandas can handle irregular time series data by resampling and interpolating.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame with irregular time series data
data = {'Timestamp': ['2023-08-01 08:00:00', '2023-08-01 09:30:00', '2023-08-01 10:45:00'],
        'Value': [100, 150, 200]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Set 'Timestamp' as index
df.set_index('Timestamp', inplace=True)

# Resample data to hourly frequency
resampled_df = df.resample('H').mean()

resampled_df
```

## **Part 5: Advanced Topics in Pandas**

### **8. Performance Optimization**
Optimizing performance is crucial when dealing with large datasets. In this section, we'll explore techniques to improve the efficiency of your Pandas code.
#### **8.1. Vectorized Operations**
Vectorized operations are a fundamental optimization technique in data processing that exploits the capabilities of vectorized data structures like NumPy arrays to perform operations efficiently on entire arrays of data, instead of using traditional iterative methods. This approach significantly improves computational speed and code readability.

**Leveraging NumPy Arrays:**
NumPy is a powerful library in Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Vectorized operations take advantage of NumPy's ability to apply operations element-wise across entire arrays, eliminating the need for explicit loops and dramatically improving performance.

In the provided example, consider a scenario where we want to double the values in a DataFrame column (`df['Value']`). We'll compare the traditional loop-based approach with a vectorized operation.

**Loop-Based Approach:**
```python
result_loop = []
for value in df['Value']:
    result_loop.append(value * 2)
```

**Vectorized Operation:**
```python
result_vectorized = df['Value'] * 2
```

In the loop-based approach, we iterate over each value in the column, multiply it by 2, and then append the result to a list. This method can be time-consuming and less efficient, especially for large datasets.

On the other hand, the vectorized operation directly applies the multiplication to the entire NumPy array (`df['Value']`) in one go. NumPy handles the element-wise computation efficiently, resulting in a faster and more concise code.

**Advantages of Vectorized Operations:**

1. **Enhanced Performance:** Vectorized operations are significantly faster than their loop-based counterparts, especially for large datasets, due to efficient memory access and optimized native code execution.

2. **Simplified Code:** Vectorized operations lead to cleaner and more readable code. They express the intent of the operation directly, without the need for explicit iteration.

3. **NumPy Optimizations:** NumPy internally optimizes operations to leverage low-level machine instructions, making the most of hardware capabilities.

4. **Ease of Parallelization:** Vectorized operations are inherently parallelizable, allowing modern hardware with multiple cores to process the data concurrently.

5. **Integration with Libraries:** Vectorized operations align well with other data analysis libraries, like pandas, making it easier to combine various tools in your analysis pipeline.

In conclusion, vectorized operations, powered by libraries like NumPy, are a cornerstone of efficient and effective data processing and analysis. By embracing vectorization, data practitioners can achieve remarkable performance improvements and streamline their code, leading to more productive and scalable data workflows.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame for vectorized operations
data = {'Value': range(1, 10001)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Using a loop
result_loop = []
for value in df['Value']:
    result_loop.append(value * 2)

# Using vectorized operation
result_vectorized = df['Value'] * 2
print(f'result_vectorized type is: {type(result_vectorized)}')

pd.DataFrame(result_vectorized.head())
```
#### **8.2. Caching and Memory Management**
Caching and memory management are techniques employed in data processing and analysis to enhance computational efficiency, reduce redundant calculations, and optimize memory utilization. These practices play a pivotal role, especially when working with substantial datasets and intricate operations.

**Caching:**
Caching involves temporarily storing the results of computations so that they can be quickly retrieved and reused later. This technique is particularly useful when the same operation needs to be performed multiple times, such as aggregating data or applying transformations. Instead of recomputing the result each time, the cached value can be retrieved, leading to significant time savings. In the context of libraries like `pandas`, caching can be enabled using specialized options like `compute.use_numexpr`. By leveraging caching, data analysts and scientists can mitigate the computational overhead associated with redundant operations, leading to more efficient workflows.

**Memory Management:**
Efficient memory management is crucial when working with large datasets to prevent performance bottlenecks and potential crashes due to excessive memory consumption. Data structures, such as DataFrames, Series, and arrays, can consume a substantial amount of memory, especially when dealing with extensive data. Memory management techniques involve optimizing memory allocation, deallocation, and usage to ensure that the available memory is used optimally and without unnecessary waste. Techniques like garbage collection and memory pooling help in freeing up memory that is no longer needed, allowing the system to allocate resources more effectively.

In the provided example, enabling caching through `pd.set_option('compute.use_numexpr', True)` leverages the `numexpr` library to speed up computations. This is particularly advantageous for mathematical operations involving large arrays or datasets. The `pd.set_option('compute.use_numexpr', False)` line disables caching and allows for a comparison between the performance of cached and uncached computations.

By implementing effective caching and memory management strategies, data analysts and scientists can:

1. **Enhance Computational Efficiency:** Caching reduces the need for redundant calculations, leading to faster execution times for frequently performed operations.

2. **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Efficient memory management ensures that memory resources are used judiciously, minimizing the risk of memory-related issues and enhancing overall system performance.

3. **Facilitate Scalability:** Caching and memory management become especially critical as the size of datasets grows. Efficient techniques enable analyses to scale up without a linear increase in computation time or memory consumption.

4. **Improve User Experience:** Faster computations and responsive analysis tools result in a better user experience, enabling more iterative and interactive exploration of data.

In conclusion, caching and memory management are indispensable tools for achieving efficient and effective data processing and analysis. By incorporating these techniques into their workflows, data practitioners can unlock the full potential of their data and optimize the performance of their analytical processes.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Enable caching
pd.set_option('compute.use_numexpr', True)

# Create a large DataFrame
data = {'Value': range(1, 10000001)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Compute sum with caching
sum_cached = df['Value'].sum()

# Disable caching
pd.set_option('compute.use_numexpr', False)

# Compute sum without caching
sum_uncached = df['Value'].sum()

print(sum_cached, sum_uncached)
```
#### **8.3. Parallel Processing**
Parallel processing is a powerful technique used to execute multiple tasks concurrently, taking advantage of modern hardware with multiple cores or processors. In data analysis, parallel processing can significantly speed up certain operations, leading to improved performance and reduced execution times.
##### **8.3.1 Single Processing**
In single processing, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other. While this is straightforward and easy to implement, it may not fully leverage the available hardware resources, especially in scenarios where the data and computations are substantial.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Create a large DataFrame
data = {'Value': np.random.randint(1, 100, size=1000000000)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Single processing: Perform a vectorized operation
result_single = df['Value'] * 2

end_time = time.time()

print("Single processing time:", end_time - start_time, "seconds")


```

In the above code, a large DataFrame is created, and a vectorized operation `(df['Value'] * 2)` is performed sequentially using single processing. The execution time is measured using the time module.
##### **8.3.2 Multi Processing**
Multi-processing involves executing tasks concurrently across multiple processors or cores. In the context of Pandas, the Dask library provides support for parallel processing for certain operations.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import dask.dataframe as dd

start_time = time.time()

# Create a large DataFrame
data = {'Value': np.random.randint(1, 100, size=1000000)}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Convert pandas DataFrame to dask DataFrame
ddf = dd.from_pandas(df, npartitions=4)  # You can adjust the number of partitions

"""
# You can also initialise the data in dask 
# Create a large Dask DataFrame
#data = {'Value': np.random.randint(1, 100, size=1000000000)}
#ddf = dd.from_dict(data, npartitions=4)  # Initialize Dask DataFrame
"""

# Perform the operation in parallel using Dask
result_dask = ddf['Value'] * 2

# Compute and retrieve the result and converts back to pandas
# note compute() is slow so do it as little as you can

result_dask = result_dask.compute() 

end_time = time.time()

print("Single processing time:", end_time - start_time, "seconds")

```

In the provided example, a Dask DataFrame is created, which is a parallel computing library that integrates well with Pandas. The operation `ddf['Value'] * 2` is performed using Dask's parallel processing capabilities. The `compute()` function triggers the parallel computation and returns a Pandas DataFrame with the result.

**Advantages of Parallel Processing:**

1. **Faster Execution:** Parallel processing can lead to significantly reduced execution times for computationally intensive tasks.

2. **Optimal Resource Utilization:** Parallel processing makes efficient use of available hardware resources, such as multiple CPU cores.

3. **Scalability:** Parallel processing can scale with the hardware, making it suitable for handling larger datasets and complex operations.

4. **Improved Performance:** Parallel processing is particularly beneficial for operations that can be parallelized, such as element-wise calculations.

5. **Enhanced Productivity:** Faster results enable data practitioners to iterate and experiment more rapidly during the analysis.

In conclusion, parallel processing, as demonstrated through the Dask library in the provided example, is a valuable technique to achieve faster and more efficient data computations in certain scenarios. By leveraging multi-core capabilities, data analysts and scientists can optimize their workflows and accomplish tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming when performed sequentially.
##### **8.3.3 Extra Content: Executing Multiple Jupyterlabs Code Cells Concurrently**
Multicore and concurrent programming in Python involves efficiently utilizing the computational power of multiple processor cores or threads to perform tasks concurrently. This is particularly important when dealing with computationally intensive operations, as it allows you to leverage hardware resources effectively and achieve faster execution times. Python offers several ways to achieve multicore/concurrent programming:

1. **Threading:**
   Threading is a way to run multiple threads (smaller units of a program) concurrently within the same process. However, due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), threading is often not as efficient for CPU-bound tasks but can be useful for I/O-bound operations.

2. **Multiprocessing:**
   The `multiprocessing` module allows you to create separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space. This bypasses the GIL and is suitable for CPU-bound tasks that can take full advantage of multiple cores.

3. **Asyncio:**
   Asynchronous programming using the `asyncio` module enables you to write non-blocking code by using coroutines. This is well-suited for I/O-bound tasks where tasks can yield control to the event loop while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

By default, Jupyter Notebook executes cells sequentially, running one cell after another. However, there are scenarios where you might want to run multiple cells simultaneously. Here are a few methods to achieve this:

**1. First Place all Cell Code in Seperate Functions**


```python
def cell1():
    #code goes here
```

```python
def cell2():
    #code goes here
```

**2. Using the Thread Pool Executor:**


```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
    executor.submit(cell1)
    executor.submit(cell2)
```

**3. Using the Process Pool Executor:**


```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as executor:
    executor.submit(cell1)
    executor.submit(cell2)
```

**4. Using the ipyparallel Extension:**

```python
from ipyparallel import Client

client = Client()
dview = client.direct_view()

dview.execute('cell1()')
dview.execute('cell2()')
```


In the examples above, we demonstrated three methods to run multiple cells simultaneously in Jupyter Notebook:

1. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module allow you to create pools of worker threads or processes and submit cell executions to them.

2. The `ipyparallel` extension provides a way to execute code in parallel across multiple IPython kernels, enabling you to leverage distributed computing.

These methods can enhance the efficiency of your Jupyter Notebook workflow, especially for computationally intensive tasks. It's important to note that not all scenarios can benefit from parallelization, and careful consideration of the problem's nature and data dependencies is crucial when choosing a parallelization strategy.
### **9. Advanced Visualization**
Advanced visualization techniques can provide deeper insights into your data. In this section, we'll explore more sophisticated ways to visualize data using Pandas.
#### **9.1. 3D Plots and Animation**
Pandas can create 3D plots and animations using Matplotlib.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Generate 3D data
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
Z = np.sin(np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2))

# Create a DataFrame from 3D data
data = {'X': X.flatten(),
        'Y': Y.flatten(),
        'Z': Z.flatten()}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a 3D scatter plot
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.scatter(df['X'], df['Y'], df['Z'])
plt.show()
```
#### **9.2. Geospatial Data Visualization**
Pandas can visualize geospatial data using Matplotlib and GeoPandas.
```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load a GeoDataFrame (using the new recommended method)
world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path('naturalearth_lowres'))
# Alternatively, you can download the dataset directly from the URL:
# world = gpd.read_file('https://naturalearth.s3.amazonaws.com/110m_cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.geojson')

# Create a plot
world.plot(column='pop_est', legend=True)
plt.title('World Population')
plt.show()

```

### **10. Functions and the `apply()` Method**
The `apply()` method in Pandas is a powerful tool for applying functions along either rows or columns of a DataFrame. It allows for advanced data transformations and custom operations across entire datasets.
#### **Custom Age Group Categorization Example**
The provided code demonstrates how to use the `apply()` method for advanced data transformation:

1. **Define Custom Function:** A custom function named `categorize_age(age)` is defined to categorize age values into different groups based on conditional logic.

2. **Create DataFrame:** A DataFrame named `df` is created with an 'Age' column containing age values.

3. **Apply Custom Function:** The `apply()` method is used to apply the `categorize_age` function to the 'Age' column. This creates a new 'Age Group' column with categorized age groups.

4. **Result:** The DataFrame `df` now includes both the original 'Age' column and the newly added 'Age Group' column, which holds the categorized age groups.

The `apply()` method offers an advanced way to efficiently perform complex transformations and calculations on DataFrame data, making it a valuable tool in advanced data analysis and manipulation tasks.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define a custom function to categorize age groups
def categorize_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        return 'Under 18'
    elif age < 35:
        return '18-34'
    elif age < 50:
        return '35-49'
    else:
        return '50+'

# Apply the custom function to a DataFrame
data = {'Age': [22, 14, 38, 55, 42]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df['Age Group'] = df['Age'].apply(categorize_age)
df
```
### **11. Memory Optimization Techniques**
Memory optimization techniques are essential when dealing with large datasets to improve performance, reduce memory consumption, and enhance the overall efficiency of your data analysis. Here are some strategies to optimize memory usage in Python, particularly when working with Pandas DataFrames:

**1. Use Appropriate Data Types:**
   Choose the most memory-efficient data types for your columns. For example, use integer types (e.g., `int32`, `uint16`) and single-precision floating-point types (e.g., `float32`) when possible.

**2. Downcast Numeric Columns:**
   Downcast integer and floating-point columns to smaller data types (e.g., downcasting `int64` to `int32`) while ensuring that data integrity is maintained.

**3. Use Categorical Data:**
   Convert categorical columns to Pandas' categorical data type (`pd.Categorical`). This saves memory by storing unique values once and using integer codes for each value.

**4. Remove Unnecessary Columns:**
   Drop columns that are not needed for analysis, reducing the memory footprint of the DataFrame.

**5. Load Data in Chunks:**
   When reading large datasets from files, use chunking (e.g., using the `chunksize` parameter in `pd.read_csv()`) to load data in smaller portions, preventing memory overload.

**6. Avoid Copying Data:**
   Be mindful of operations that create copies of dataframes, such as subsetting with `.loc` or `.iloc`. Instead, use `.loc` with boolean indexing to modify values in place.

**7. Optimize String Storage:**
   For string columns, consider using the `string` data type introduced in Pandas 1.0. This optimizes memory usage for string data.

**8. Use External Libraries:**
   Utilize external libraries like Dask or Vaex for out-of-core computing, which allows working with datasets larger than available memory.

**9. Profile Memory Usage:**
   Use memory profiling tools like `memory_profiler` to identify memory-hungry parts of your code and optimize them.

**10. Garbage Collection:**
   Manually trigger garbage collection using `gc.collect()` to free up unused memory.

Implementing these memory optimization techniques can lead to substantial improvements in memory efficiency, which is crucial for smooth and responsive data analysis, especially when dealing with large datasets. Always balance memory optimization with data integrity and analysis requirements to ensure accurate results.

Here's and example:
```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# Create a DataFrame with optimized data types
data = {'A': range(1, 100001),
        'B': [0.1] * 100000}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

display(Markdown("**Before optimization**"))
display(df.memory_usage(deep=True))

# Optimize data types
df['A'] = pd.to_numeric(df['A'], downcast='unsigned')
df['B'] = df['B'].astype('float32')

display(Markdown("**After optimization**"))
display(df.memory_usage(deep=True))
```
