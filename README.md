# Data Science Handbooks

Welcome to the **Data Science Handbooks** repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Markdown files that serve as handbooks for various topics in the field of data science. Whether you're new to the field or an experienced practitioner, these resources will provide insights and guidance on important concepts. Note that this repo is a work in progress, so use it at your own discretion.

## Table of Contents

- [pandas.ipynb](pandas.ipynb): This notebook is a guide to using the `pandas`` library for data manipulation and analysis. Explore the powerful features of pandas and how to effectively work with data frames.

- [SQL Database Tutorial Handbook.md](SQL%20Database%20Tutorial%20Handbook.md): This comprehensive Markdown file serves as a handbook for working with SQL databases using Python. Explore topics ranging from setting up databases to querying data via Python API and Pandas.

- [correlation_methods.ipynb](correlation_methods.ipynb): Learn about different correlation methods to analyze relationships between variables. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to calculate and interpret correlations.

- [Statistical Significance and Margin of Error Handbook.ipynb](Statistical%20Significance%20and%20Margin%20of%20Error%20Handbook.ipynb): Delve into the essential concepts of statistical significance and margin of error. This Jupyter notebook offers clear explanations and practical examples.

- [outliers.ipynb](outliers.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that explores the topic of outliers in data analysis. Learn how to identify, handle, and interpret outliers in your datasets.

## How to Use

Each Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) and Markdown file (`*.md`) in this repository is designed to be interactive and educational. You can view them directly on GitHub, but for the best experience, it's recommended to download and run them on your local machine using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This way, you can actively engage with the code examples and experiment with the concepts.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository. If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional topics you'd like to see covered, please submit an issue or a pull request. Let's learn and grow together in the exciting world of data science!
