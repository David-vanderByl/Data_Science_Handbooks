# Data Science Handbooks

Welcome to the **Data Science Handbooks** repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Markdown files that serve as handbooks for various topics in the field of data science. Whether you're new to the field or an experienced practitioner, these resources will provide insights and guidance on important concepts. Note this repo is a bit of a work in progress so use at you own discretion.

## Table of Contents

- [pandas.ipynb](pandas.ipynb): This notebook is a guide to using the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Explore the powerful features of pandas and how to effectively work with data frames.

- [pandas.md](pandas.md): A condensed version in Markdown format of the content covered in the `pandas.ipynb` notebook.


- [correlation_methods.ipynb](correlation_methods.ipynb): Learn about different correlation methods to analyze relationships between variables. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to calculate and interpret correlations.

- [correlation_methods.md](correlation_methods.md): A Markdown file outlining the various correlation methods discussed in the `correlation_methods.ipynb` notebook.

- [Statistical Significance and Margin of Error Handbook.ipynb](Statistical%20Significance%20and%20Margin%20of%20Error%20Handbook.ipynb): Delve into the essential concepts of statistical significance and margin of error. This Jupyter notebook offers clear explanations and practical examples.

- [Statistical Significance and Margin of Error Handbook.md](Statistical%20Significance%20and%20Margin%20of%20Error%20Handbook.md): An accompanying Markdown file that summarizes the key takeaways from the `Statistical Significance and Margin of Error Handbook.ipynb` notebook.

- [outliers.ipynb](outliers.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that explores the topic of outliers in data analysis. Learn how to identify, handle, and interpret outliers in your datasets.

- [outliers.md](outliers.md): A corresponding Markdown file providing a comprehensive overview of the outlier detection and treatment methods discussed in the `outliers.ipynb` notebook.

## How to Use

Each Jupyter notebook (`*.ipynb`) in this repository is designed to be interactive and educational. You can view them directly on GitHub, but for the best experience, it's recommended to download and run them on your local machine using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This way, you can actively engage with the code examples and experiment with the concepts.

The corresponding Markdown files (`*.md`) provide concise summaries of the topics covered in the Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to quickly review key points without running the code.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to this repository. If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional topics you'd like to see covered, please submit an issue or a pull request. Let's learn and grow together in the exciting world of data science!
