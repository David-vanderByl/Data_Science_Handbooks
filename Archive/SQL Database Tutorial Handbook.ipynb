    "#### 2.1 Using Docker for MySQL\n",
    "Docker allows us to run applications in isolated containers. Here's how to set up MySQL using Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Docker on your platform.\n",
    "2. Pull the MySQL image:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker pull mysql:latest\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Run a MySQL container:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run --name=mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mysql -h localhost -u root -p\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Enter your password and start querying:\n",
